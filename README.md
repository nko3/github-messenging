# github-messenging

The idea was to make this a website similar to gtalk.
A user login's with this github account.  We get his
following and add them as friends he wants to talk to.
If the user is online, we should as available for chat,
else we send an email with his text.

Of course, this was the grandiose plan.  Being solo meant
I couldn't complete many of these.  So I got to the stage
where I pull the following list and nothing much.  For
what it is worth, this was the [effort][1]

If you feel very inclined, do vote for this effort.
