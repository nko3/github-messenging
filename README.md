# github-messenging

The idea was to make a website similar to gtalk for github
users.  A user logs with this github account.  We get his
following list and add them as friends he wants to talk to.
If the user is online, we show as available for chat,
else we send an email with his text.

Of course, this was the grandiose plan.  Being solo meant
I couldn't complete many of these.  So I got to the stage
where I pull the following list and nothing much.  For
what it is worth, this was the [effort][1]

If you feel very inclined, do vote for the effort.  Thanks.

### Setup

        $ npm install
        $ node server.js
